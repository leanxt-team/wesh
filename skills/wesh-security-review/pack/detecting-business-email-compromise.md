## Prerequisites
- Email security gateway with BEC detection capabilities
- Understanding of organizational financial processes and approval chains
- Access to email logs and SIEM platform
- Knowledge of social engineering tactics

## Key Concepts

### BEC Attack Types (FBI IC3 Classification)
1. **CEO Fraud**: Attacker impersonates CEO, requests urgent wire transfer
2. **Account Compromise**: Employee email compromised, used to request payments from vendors
3. **False Invoice Scheme**: Fake invoices from "vendor" with changed bank details
4. **Attorney Impersonation**: Impersonates legal counsel for urgent confidential transfers
5. **Data Theft**: Requests W-2, tax forms, or PII from HR

### Detection Indicators
- Urgency and secrecy language ("confidential", "do not discuss with others")
- New or changed payment instructions
- Executive communication outside normal patterns
- Display name matches executive but email domain differs
- Reply-to address differs from From address
- First-time communication pattern between sender and recipient
- Request for gift cards or cryptocurrency

## Workflow

### Step 1: Configure BEC-Specific Email Rules
- Flag emails with VIP display names from external domains
- Detect financial keywords combined with urgency language
- Alert on first-time sender to finance/accounting staff
- Check for Reply-To domain mismatch

### Step 2: Deploy Behavioral Analytics
- Baseline normal communication patterns per user
- Detect anomalous requests (unusual recipient, unusual time, unusual request type)
- Monitor for email forwarding rule changes (T1114.003)

### Step 3: Implement Financial Controls
- Dual-authorization for wire transfers above threshold
- Out-of-band verification for payment detail changes (phone callback)
- Vendor payment change verification process
- Finance team training on BEC red flags

### Step 4: Monitor for Account Compromise
- Detect impossible travel in email login locations
- Alert on email forwarding rule creation
- Monitor for mailbox delegation changes
- Check for inbox rules hiding BEC-related emails

## Tools & Resources
- **Microsoft Defender for O365 Anti-BEC**: Built-in BEC detection
