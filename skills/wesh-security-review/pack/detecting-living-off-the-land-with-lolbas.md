## Prerequisites

- Sysmon or Windows Security Event Log (Event ID 4688) with command-line logging enabled
- Sigma rule conversion tool (sigmac or sigma-cli)
- SIEM platform (Splunk, Elastic, or similar) for log ingestion
- Python 3.8+ with pySigma library
- LOLBAS project reference database

## Steps

1. **Establish LOLBin Watchlist** — Build prioritized list of monitored binaries (certutil, mshta, regsvr32, rundll32, msbuild, installutil, cmstp, wmic, bitsadmin)
2. **Collect Process Telemetry** — Ingest Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Create) and Windows 4688 events with full command-line capture
3. **Build Sigma Detection Rules** — Create Sigma rules matching suspicious command-line arguments, network activity, and parent-child process anomalies for each LOLBin
4. **Analyze Parent-Child Relationships** — Flag unexpected parent processes spawning LOLBins (e.g., Excel spawning certutil, Word spawning mshta)
5. **Score and Prioritize Alerts** — Apply risk scoring based on argument anomaly, parent process, execution path, and network indicators
6. **Generate Detection Report** — Produce structured report of all LOLBin abuse detections with MITRE ATT&CK mapping
