## Prerequisites

- Windows Event Log exports (.evtx) from Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
- Python 3.8+ with python-evtx and lxml libraries
- Script Block Logging enabled via Group Policy
- Understanding of common PowerShell attack techniques

## Steps

1. Parse EVTX files extracting Event 4104 script block text and metadata
2. Reassemble multi-part script blocks using ScriptBlock ID correlation
3. Scan script text for AMSI bypass indicators and obfuscation patterns
4. Detect encoded command execution and base64 payloads
5. Identify download cradles, credential dumping, and lateral movement commands
6. Score and prioritize findings by threat severity
