## Prerequisites

- Network proxy/firewall logs with byte-level data transfer metrics
- DLP solution or CASB with cloud upload visibility
- DNS query logs for DNS exfiltration detection
- Email gateway logs for attachment monitoring
- SIEM with data volume anomaly detection capabilities

## Workflow

1. **Define Exfiltration Channels**: Identify potential channels (HTTP/S uploads, DNS tunneling, email attachments, cloud storage, removable media, encrypted protocols).
2. **Baseline Normal Data Flows**: Establish baseline outbound data transfer volumes per user, host, and destination over 30-day window.
3. **Detect Volume Anomalies**: Identify hosts or users transferring significantly more data than baseline to external destinations.
4. **Analyze Transfer Destinations**: Check destination domains/IPs against threat intel, identify newly registered domains, personal cloud storage, and foreign infrastructure.
5. **Inspect Protocol Abuse**: Look for DNS tunneling (large/frequent TXT queries), ICMP tunneling, or data hidden in allowed protocols.
6. **Correlate with File Access**: Link exfiltration indicators to file access events on sensitive file shares, databases, or repositories.
7. **Report and Contain**: Document findings with evidence, estimate data exposure, and recommend containment actions.
