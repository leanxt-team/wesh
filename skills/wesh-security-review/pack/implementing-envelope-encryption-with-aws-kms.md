description: Implements envelope encryption with AWS KMS, encrypting data locally with a data encryption key (DEK) and protecting that DEK with a KMS-managed key (KEK), covering the encrypt/decrypt flow, KMS key types, and security validation criteria.

## Codegraph (do this first)
1. `codegraph_explore "crypto usage"` — locate cipher/sign/verify/hash/KDF call sites; `impact` before changing algorithm, mode or key handling. Output = read.
2. Fixing shared code: `codegraph callers <fn>` + `codegraph impact <fn>` before editing. One root-cause fix, owning layer, every call site covered.
3. Tests: `git diff --name-only | codegraph affected --stdin`. None at the seam = add one.
4. Before "unused"/rename/delete: `codegraph sync`, then grep. No graph yet: grep for the sinks above.
Any "grep/search the codebase" step below → use these calls instead; keep grep for strings, config and dynamic refs.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cryptography concepts and tools
- Access to test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Key Concepts

### Envelope Encryption Flow

1. Call `kms:GenerateDataKey` to get plaintext DEK + encrypted DEK
2. Use plaintext DEK to encrypt data locally (AES-256-GCM)
3. Store encrypted DEK alongside ciphertext
4. Discard plaintext DEK from memory
5. For decryption: call `kms:Decrypt` on encrypted DEK, then decrypt data

### Advantages Over Direct KMS Encryption

| Aspect | Direct KMS | Envelope Encryption |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Max data size | 4 KB | Unlimited |
| Latency | Network round-trip per operation | Local encryption |
| Cost | $0.03/10,000 requests | Fewer KMS requests |
| Offline | Not possible | Yes (with cached DEKs) |

### KMS Key Types

- **AWS Managed**: AWS creates and manages (`aws/s3`, `aws/ebs`)
- **Customer Managed**: You create and manage policies
- **Custom Key Store**: Backed by CloudHSM cluster

## Security Considerations

- Never store plaintext DEK; only keep encrypted DEK
- Use key policies to restrict who can call GenerateDataKey and Decrypt
- Enable AWS CloudTrail logging for all KMS API calls
- Implement key rotation (automatic annual rotation for CMKs)
- Use encryption context for authenticated encryption metadata
- Handle KMS throttling with exponential backoff

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] GenerateDataKey returns plaintext and encrypted DEK
- [ ] Data encrypts correctly with plaintext DEK using AES-256-GCM
- [ ] Encrypted DEK can be decrypted via KMS Decrypt API
- [ ] Decrypted DEK recovers original data
- [ ] Plaintext DEK is wiped from memory after use
- [ ] Encryption context is validated during decryption
- [ ] Key rotation re-encrypts DEKs with new master key
