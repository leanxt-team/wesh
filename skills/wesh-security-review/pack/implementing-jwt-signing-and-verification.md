## Codegraph (do this first)
1. `codegraph_explore "JWT verify/sign"` — locate verify()/decode()/sign() call sites; `callers` to see who trusts the claims. Output = read.
2. Fixing shared code: `codegraph callers <fn>` + `codegraph impact <fn>` before editing. One root-cause fix, owning layer, every call site covered.
3. Tests: `git diff --name-only | codegraph affected --stdin`. None at the seam = add one.
4. Before "unused"/rename/delete: `codegraph sync`, then grep. No graph yet: grep for the sinks above.
Any "grep/search the codebase" step below → use these calls instead; keep grep for strings, config and dynamic refs.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cryptography concepts and tools
- Access to test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Key Concepts

### JWT Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Key | Security Level |
|-----------|------|-----|---------------|
| HS256 | Symmetric (HMAC) | Shared secret | 128-bit |
| RS256 | Asymmetric (RSA) | RSA key pair | 112-bit |
| ES256 | Asymmetric (ECDSA) | P-256 key pair | 128-bit |
| EdDSA | Asymmetric (Ed25519) | Ed25519 pair | 128-bit |

### Common JWT Attacks

- **Algorithm confusion**: Switching from RS256 to HS256, using public key as HMAC secret
- **None algorithm**: Setting alg=none to bypass signature verification
- **Key injection**: Embedding key in JWK header
- **Weak secrets**: Brute-forcing short HMAC secrets
- **Token replay**: Reusing valid tokens without expiration

## Security Considerations

- Always validate algorithm header against allowlist
- Never accept alg=none in production
- Use asymmetric algorithms (RS256, ES256) for distributed systems
- Set short expiration times (15 min for access tokens)
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Store secrets securely (not in source code)

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] JWT signing produces valid tokens for all algorithms
- [ ] Signature verification rejects tampered tokens
- [ ] Expired tokens are rejected
- [ ] Algorithm confusion attack is prevented
- [ ] None algorithm is rejected
- [ ] JWK key rotation works correctly
- [ ] Claims validation enforces all required claims
